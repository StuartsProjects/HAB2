Program Notes

This folder contains the main program (.ino) file and any other program files unique to the program,  these will be the .h file(s). 

The main program file requires a number of other program files such as the LoRa program and GPS routines, these are common for all the LoRaTracker programs and are contained in the accompanying ZIP file. 

You can either unzip the files into the program directory or unzip them and install as a library by creating a LoRaTracker folder in the Arduino libraries folder;

\arduino\libraries\LoRaTracker\


and then coping all the files in the ZIP file to that folder.
